 * shared by gnutls session structures.  You should call
 * gnutls_global_deinit() when gnutls usage is no longer needed
 *
 * Note that this function will also initialize libgcrypt, if it has
 * not been initialized before.  Thus if you want to manually
 * initialize libgcrypt you must do it before calling this function.
 * This is useful in cases you want to disable libgcrypt's internal
 * lockings etc.
 *
 * This function increment a global counter, so that
 * gnutls_global_deinit() only releases resources when it has been
 * called as many times as gnutls_global_init().  This is useful when
 * GnuTLS is used by more than one library in an application.  This
 * function can be called many times, but will only do something the
 * first time.
 *
 * Note!  This function is not thread safe.  If two threads call this
 * function simultaneously, they can cause a race between checking
 * the global counter and incrementing it, causing both threads to
 * execute the library initialization code.  That would lead to a
 * memory leak.  To handle this, your application could invoke this
 * function after aquiring a thread mutex.  To ignore the potential
 * memory leak is also an option.
 *
 * Returns: On success, %GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (zero) is returned,
 *   otherwise an error code is returned.
