/**
 * gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname:
 * @cert: should contain an gnutls_x509_crt_t structure
 * @hostname: A null terminated string that contains a DNS name
 *
 * This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches
 * the given hostname.  This is a basic implementation of the matching
 * described in RFC2818 (HTTPS), which takes into account wildcards,
 * and the DNSName/IPAddress subject alternative name PKIX extension.
 *
 * Returns: non zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.
