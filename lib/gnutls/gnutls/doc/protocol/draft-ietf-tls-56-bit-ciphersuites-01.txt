2.  Introduction

   This document describes several cipher suites to be used with the 
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  Changes in US export
   regulations in 1999 permitted the export of software programs 
   using 56-bit data encryption and 1024-bit key exchange.  
   The cipher suites described in this document were designed to take
   advantage of this change in the regulations.

3. The CipherSuites

   The following values define the CipherSuite codes used in the client
   hello and server hello messages.

   The following CipherSuite definitions require that the server
   provide an RSA certificate that can be used for key exchange. The
   server may request either an RSA or a DSS signature-capable
   certificate in the certificate request message.

   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_EXPORT1024_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x62 };
   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_EXPORT1024_WITH_RC4_56_SHA      = { 0x00,0x64 };

   The following CipherSuite definitions are used for
   server-authenticated (and optionally client-authenticated)
   Diffie-Hellman.  DHE denotes ephemeral Diffie-Hellman, where the
   Diffie-Hellman parameters are signed by a DSS certificate, which
   has been signed by the CA. 

   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_EXPORT1024_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA = { 0x00,0x63 };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_EXPORT1024_WITH_RC4_56_SHA  = { 0x00,0x65 };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_RC4_128_SHA            = { 0x00,0x66 };

   Key size limit
       The key size limit gives the size of the largest public key that
       can be legally used for encryption in cipher suites that are
       exportable.

5. Implementation Notes

   When an RSA_EXPORT1024 cipher suite is used, and the server's RSA
   Key is larger than 1024 bits in length, then the server must send
   a server key exchange message to the client. This message is to
   contain a temporary RSA key, signed by the server. This temporary
   RSA key should be the maximum allowable length (i.e., 1024 bits).

INTERNET-DRAFT             56-bit Export TLS          January 15, 1999


   Servers with a large RSA key will often maintain two temporary RSA
   keys: a 512-bit key used to support the RSA_EXPORT cipher suites,
   and a 1024-bit key used to support the RSA_EXPORT1024 cipher suites.

   When 56-bit DES keys are derived for an export cipher suite, the
   additional export key derivation step must be performed. That is,
   the final read and write DES keys (and the IV) are not taken 
   directly from the key_block.
