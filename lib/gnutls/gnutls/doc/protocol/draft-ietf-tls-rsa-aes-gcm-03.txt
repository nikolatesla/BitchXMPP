Internet-Draft            AES-GCM Cipher suites               April 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of AES [AES] in Galois Counter Mode
   (GCM) [GCM] (AES-GCM) with various key exchange mechanisms as a
   cipher suite for TLS.  AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption with
   associated data (AEAD) cipher (as defined in TLS 1.2
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis]) providing both confidentiality and data
   origin authentication.  The following sections define cipher suites
   based on RSA, DSS and Diffie-Hellman key exchanges; ECC based cipher
   suites are defined in a separate document [I-D.ietf-tls-ecc-new-mac].

   AES-GCM is not only efficient and secure, but hardware
   implementations can achieve high speeds with low cost and low
   latency, because the mode can be pipelined.  Applications that
   require high data throughput can benefit from these high-speed
   implementations.  AES-GCM has been specified as a mode that can be
   used with IPsec ESP [RFC4106] and 802.1AE MAC Security [IEEE8021AE].


2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  AES-GCM Cipher Suites

   The following cipher suites use the new authenticated encryption
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 with AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM]:

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}

   These cipher suites use the AES-GCM authenticated encryption with
   associated data (AEAD) algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM and
   AEAD_AES_256_GCM described in [RFC5116].  Note that each of these
   AEAD algorithms uses a 128-bit authentication tag with GCM.  The

Internet-Draft            AES-GCM Cipher suites               April 2008


   "nonce" SHALL be 12 bytes long consisting of two parts as follows:
   (this is an example of a "partially explicit" nonce; see section
   3.2.1 in [RFC5116]).

             struct{
                opaque salt[4];
                opaque nonce_explicit[8];
             } GCMNonce;

   The salt is the "implicit" part of the nonce and is not sent in the
   packet.  Instead the salt is generated as part of the handshake
   process: it is either the client_write_IV (when the client is
   sending) or the server_write_IV (when the server is sending).  The
   salt length (SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length) is 4 octets.

   The nonce_explicit is the "explicit" part of the nonce.  It is chosen
   by the sender and is carried in each TLS record in the
   GenericAEADCipher.nonce_explicit field.  The nonce_explicit length
   (SecurityParameters.record_iv_length) is 8 octets.

   Each value of the nonce_explicit MUST be distinct for each distinct
   invocation of GCM encrypt function for any fixed key.  Failure to
   meet this uniqueness requirement can significantly degrade security.
   The nonce_explicit MAY be the 64-bit sequence number.

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, and DH_anon key exchanges
   are performed as defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis].

   The PRF algorithms SHALL be as follows:

      For cipher suites ending with _SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF
      [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] with SHA-256 as the hash function.

      For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF
      [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] with SHA-384 as the hash function.

   Implementations MUST send TLS Alert bad_record_mac for all types of
   failures encountered in processing the AES-GCM algorithm.


4.  TLS Versions

   These cipher suites make use of the authenticated encryption with
   additional data defined in TLS 1.2 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis].  They
   MUST NOT be negotiated in older versions of TLS.  Clients MUST NOT
   offer these cipher suites if they do not offer TLS 1.2 or later.
   Servers which select an earlier version of TLS MUST NOT select one of
   these cipher suites.  Because TLS has no way for the client to

   indicate that it supports TLS 1.2 but not earlier, a non-compliant
   server might potentially negotiate TLS 1.1 or earlier and select one
   of the cipher suites in this document.  Clients MUST check the TLS
   version and generate a fatal "illegal_parameter" alert if they detect
   an incorrect version.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following values for the cipher suites defined
   in this draft:

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] apply to
   this document as well.  The remainder of this section describes
   security considerations specific to the cipher suites described in
   this document.

6.1.  Counter Reuse

   AES-GCM security requires that the counter is never reused.  The IV
   construction in Section 3 is designed to prevent counter reuse.

6.2.  Recommendations for Multiple Encryption Processors

   If multiple cryptographic processors are in use by the sender, then
   the sender MUST ensure that, for a particular key, each value of the
   nonce_explicit used with that key is distinct.  In this case each
   encryption processor SHOULD include in the nonce_explicit a fixed
   value that is distinct for each processor.  The recommended format is

        nonce_explicit = FixedDistinct || Variable




Salowey, et al.         Expires October 16, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            AES-GCM Cipher suites               April 2008


   where the FixedDistinct field is distinct for each encryption
   processor, but is fixed for a given processor, and the Variable field
   is distinct for each distinct nonce used by a particular encryption
   processor.  When this method is used, the FixedDistinct fields used
   by the different processors MUST have the same length.

   In the terms of Figure 2 in [RFC5116], the Salt is the Fixed-Common
   part of the nonce (it is fixed, and it is common across all
   encryption processors), the FixedDistinct field exactly corresponds
   to the Fixed-Distinct field, and the Variable field corresponds to
   the Counter field, and the explicit part exactly corresponds to the
   nonce_explicit.

   For clarity, we provide an example for TLS in which there are two
   distinct encryption processors, each of which uses a one-byte
   FixedDistinct field:

          Salt          = eedc68dc
          FixedDistinct = 01       (for the first encryption processor)
          FixedDistinct = 02       (for the second encryption processor)

   The GCMnonces generated by the first encryption processor, and their
   corresponding nonce_explicit, are:

          GCMNonce                    nonce_explicit
          ------------------------    ----------------------------
          eedc68dc0100000000000000    0100000000000000
          eedc68dc0100000000000001    0100000000000001
          eedc68dc0100000000000002    0100000000000002
          ...

   The GCMnonces generated by the second encryption processor, and their
   corresponding nonce_explicit, are

          GCMNonce                    nonce_explicit
          ------------------------    ----------------------------
          eedc68dc0200000000000000    0200000000000000
          eedc68dc0200000000000001    0200000000000001
          eedc68dc0200000000000002    0200000000000002
          ...
