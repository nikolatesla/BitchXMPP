Abstract

   A number of protocols wish to leverage Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   to perform key establishment but then use some of the keying material
   for their own purposes.  This document describes a general mechanism
   for allowing that.

1.  Introduction

   A number of protocols wish to leverage Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [4] or Datagram TLS (DTLS) [5] to perform key establishment but then
   use some of the keying material for their own purposes.  A typical
   example is DTLS-SRTP [6], which uses DTLS to perform a key exchange
   and negotiate the SRTP [3] protection suite and then uses the DTLS
   master_secret to generate the SRTP keys.

   These applications imply a need to be able to extract Exported Keying
   Material (EKM) from TLS/DTLS.  This mechanism has the following
   requirements:

   o  Both client and server need to be able to extract the same EKM
      value.
   o  EKM values should be indistinguishable from random by attackers
      who don't know the master_secret.
   o  It should be possible to extract multiple EKM values from the same
      TLS/DTLS association.
   o  Knowing one EKM value should not reveal any information about the
      master_secret or about other EKM values.

   The mechanism described in this document is intended to fill these
   requirements.


2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  Extractor Definition

   An extractor takes as input two values:

   o  A disambiguating label string
   o  A length value

   It then computes:


          PRF(master_secret, "EXTRACTOR" + label,
              SecurityParameters.client_random +
              SecurityParameters.server_random)[length]

   The output is a pseudorandom bit string of length bytes generated

   from the master_secret.

   Label values MUST be registered via Specification Required as
   described by RFC 2434 [2].


4.  Security Considerations

   Because an extractor produces the same value if applied twice with
   the same label to the same master_secret, it is critical that two EKM
   values generated with the same label be used for two different
   purposes--hence the requirement for IANA registration.  However,
   because extractors depend on the TLS PRF, it is not a threat to the
   use of an EKM value generated from one label to reveal an EKM value
   generated from another label.


5.  IANA Considerations

   Section Section 3 requires that all extractor labels be registered
   via 2434 Specification Required.  IANA has created a TLSExtractor
   registry for this purpose.  Future values MUST be allocated via
   Specification Required as described in [RFC2434].
