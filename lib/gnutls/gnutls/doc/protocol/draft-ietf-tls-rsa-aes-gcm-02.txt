Internet-Draft            AES-GCM Ciphersuites             February 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of AES [AES]in Galois Counter Mode
   (GCM) [GCM] (AES-GCM) with various key exchange mechanisms as a
   ciphersuite for TLS.  AES-GCM is not only efficient and secure, but
   hardware implementations can achieve high speeds with low cost and
   low latency, because the mode can be pipelined.  Applications like
   CAPWAP, which uses DTLS, can benefit from the high-speed
   implementations when wireless termination points (WTPs) and
   controllers (ACs) have to meet requirements to support higher
   throughputs in the future.  AES-GCM has been specified as a mode that
   can be used with IPsec ESP [RFC4106] and 802.1AE MAC Security
   [IEEE8021AE].  This document defines ciphersutes based on RSA, DSS
   and Diffie-Hellman key exchanges; ECC based ciphersuites are defined
   in a separate document [I-D.ietf-tls-ecc-new-mac].  AES-GCM is an
   authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher, as
   defined in TLS 1.2 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis].  The ciphersuites
   defined in this draft may be used with Datagram TLS defined in
   [RFC4347].  This memo uses GCM in a way similar to
   [I-D.ietf-tls-ecc-new-mac].


2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]


3.  AES-GCM Cipher Suites

   The following ciphersuites use the new authenticated encryption modes
   defined in TLS 1.2 with AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM]:

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}

   These ciphersuites use the AES-GCM authenticated encryption with

Internet-Draft            AES-GCM Ciphersuites             February 2008


   associated data (AEAD) algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM and
   AEAD_AES_256_GCM described in [RFC5116].  Note that each of these
   AEAD algorithms uses a 128-bit authentication tag with GCM.  The
   "nonce" SHALL be 12 bytes long and it is "partially implicit" (see
   section 3.2.1 in [RFC5116]).  Part of the nonce is generated as part
   of the handshake process and is static for the entire session and the
   other part is carried in each packet.

             Struct{
                opaque salt[4];
                opaque explicit_nonce_part[8];
             } GCMNonce

   The salt is the "implicit" part of the nonce and is not sent in the
   packet.  It is either the client_write_IV if the client is sending or
   the server_write_IV if the server is sending.  These IVs SHALL be 4
   bytes long, therefore, for all the algorithms defined in this
   section, SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length=4.

   The explicit_nonce_part is chosen by the sender and included in the
   packet.  Each value of the explicit_nonce_part MUST be distinct for
   each distinct invocation of GCM encrypt function for any fixed key.
   Failure to meet this uniqueness requirement can significantly degrade
   security.  The explicit_nonce_part is carried in the IV field of the
   GenericAEADCipher structure.  For all the algorithms defined in this
   section, SecurityParameters.record_iv_length=8.

   In the case of TLS the explicit_nonce_part MAY be the 64-bit sequence
   number.  In the case of Datagram TLS [RFC4347] the
   explicit_nonce_part MAY be formed from the concatenation of the 16-
   bit epoch with the 48-bit DTLS seq_num.

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, and DH_anon key exchanges
   are performed as defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis].

   The PRF algorithms SHALL be as follows:

   For ciphersuites ending in _SHA256 the hash function is SHA256.

   For ciphersuites ending in _SHA384 the hash function is SHA384.


4.  TLS Versions

   These ciphersuites make use of the authenticated encryption with
   additional data defined in TLS 1.2 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis].  They
   MUST NOT be negotiated in older versions of TLS.  Clients MUST NOT
   offer these cipher suites if they do not offer TLS 1.2 or later.

Internet-Draft            AES-GCM Ciphersuites             February 2008


   Servers which select an earlier version of TLS MUST NOT select one of
   these cipher suites.  Because TLS has no way for the client to
   indicate that it supports TLS 1.2 but not earlier, a non-compliant
   server might potentially negotiate TLS 1.1 or earlier and select one
   of the cipher suites in this document.  Clients MUST check the TLS
   version and generate a fatal "illegal_parameter" alert if they detect
   an incorrect version.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following values for the ciphersuites defined
   in this draft:

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] apply to
   this document as well.  The remainder of this section describes
   security considerations specific to the cipher suites described in
   this document.

6.1.  Counter Reuse

   AES-GCM security requires that the counter is never reused.  The IV
   construction in Section 3 is designed to prevent counter reuse.

6.2.  Recommendations for Multiple Encryption Processors

   If multiple cryptographic processors are in use by the sender, then
   the sender MUST ensure that, for a particular key, each value of the
   explicit_nonce_part used with that key is distinct.  In this case
   each encryption processor SHOULD include in the explicit_nonce_part a
   fixed value that is distinct for each processor.  The recommended
   format is

Internet-Draft            AES-GCM Ciphersuites             February 2008


        explicit_nonce_part = FixedDistinct || Variable

   where the FixedDistinct field is distinct for each encryption
   processor, but is fixed for a given processor, and the Variable field
   is distinct for each distinct nonce used by a particular encryption
   processor.  When this method is used, the FixedDistinct fields used
   by the different processors MUST have the same length.

   In the terms of Figure 2 in [RFC5116], the Salt is the Fixed-Common
   part of the nonce (it is fixed, and it is common across all
   encryption processors), the FixedDistinct field exactly corresponds
   to the Fixed-Distinct field, and the Variable field corresponds to
   the Counter field, and the explicit part exactly corresponds to the
   explicit_nonce_part.

   For clarity, we provide an example for TLS in which there are two
   distinct encryption processors, each of which uses a one-byte
   FixedDistinct field:

          Salt          = eedc68dc
          FixedDistinct = 01       (for the first encryption processor)
          FixedDistinct = 02       (for the second encryption processor)

   The GCMnonces generated by the first encryption processor, and their
   corresponding explicit_nonce_parts, are:

          GCMNonce                    explicit_nonce_part
          ------------------------    ----------------------------
          eedc68dc0100000000000000    0100000000000000
          eedc68dc0100000000000001    0100000000000001
          eedc68dc0100000000000002    0100000000000002
          ...

   The GCMnonces generated by the second encryption processor, and their
   corresponding explicit_nonce_parts, are

          GCMNonce                    explicit_nonce_part
          ------------------------    ----------------------------
          eedc68dc0200000000000000    0200000000000000
          eedc68dc0200000000000001    0200000000000001
          eedc68dc0200000000000002    0200000000000002
          ...
