Abstract

   RFC 4492 describes elliptic curve cipher suites for Transport Layer
   Security (TLS).  However, all those cipher suites use SHA-1 as their
   MAC algorithm.  This document describes sixteen new cipher suites for
   TLS which specify stronger digest algorithms.  Eight use HMAC with
   SHA-256 or SHA-384 and eight use AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).

Internet-Draft               TLS ECC New MAC                    May 2008


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4492 [RFC4492] describes Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) cipher
   suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS).  However, all of the RFC
   4492 suites use HMAC-SHA1 as their MAC algorithm.  Due to recent
   analytic work on SHA-1 [Wang05], the IETF is gradually moving away
   from SHA-1 and towards stronger hash algorithms.  This document
   specifies TLS ECC cipher suites which use SHA-256 and SHA-384 [SHS]
   rather than SHA-1.

   TLS 1.2 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis], adds support for authenticated
   encryption with additional data (AEAD) cipher modes [RFC5116].  This
   document also specifies a set of ECC cipher suites using one such
   mode, Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM].  Another document
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rsa-aes-gcm], provides support for GCM with other key
   establishment methods.


2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Cipher Suites

   This document defines 16 new cipher suites to be added to TLS.  All
   use Elliptic Curve Cryptography for key exchange and digital
   signature, as defined in RFC 4492.

3.1.  HMAC-based Cipher Suites

   The first eight cipher suites use AES [AES] in CBC [CBC] mode with an
   HMAC-based MAC:

       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384   = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256    = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384    = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256     = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384     = {0xXX,XX};

   These eight cipher suites are the same as the corresponding cipher
   suites in RFC 4492 (with names ending in "_SHA" in place of "_SHA256"
   or "_SHA384"), except for the hash and PRF algorithms.

   These SHALL be as follows:

   o  For cipher suites ending with _SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF
      [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] with SHA-256 as the hash function.  The
      MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA-256 as the hash function.
   o  For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF
      [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] with SHA-384 as the hash function.  The
      MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA-384 as the hash function.

3.2.  Galois Counter Mode-based Cipher Suites

   The second eight cipher suites use the same asymmetric algorithms as
   those in the previous section but use the new authenticated
   encryption modes defined in TLS 1.2 with AES in Galois Counter Mode
   (GCM) [GCM]:

       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384    = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256     = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384     = {0xXX,XX};

   These cipher suites use authenticated encryption with additional data
   algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM described in
   [RFC5116].  GCM is used as described in [I-D.ietf-tls-rsa-aes-gcm].

   The PRFs SHALL be as follows:

   o  For cipher suites ending with _SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF
      [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] with SHA-256 as the hash function.
   o  For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF
      [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] with SHA-384 as the hash function.


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in RFC 4346, RFC 4492, and
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rsa-aes-gcm] apply to this document as well.  In
   addition, as described in [I-D.ietf-tls-rsa-aes-gcm], these cipher
   suites may only be used with TLS 1.2 or greater.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following values for these cipher suites:

       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xXX,XX};

       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384  = {0xXX,XX};

       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384    = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256     = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384     = {0xXX,XX};
