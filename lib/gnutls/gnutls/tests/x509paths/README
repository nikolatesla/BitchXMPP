Because of unclear license, they are not distributed with GnuTLS
currently.

See the PDF for information regarding the self tests.  Particular
comments on individual tests below.  The 'XXX' marks real bugs.

Chain 13-14,65: We probably should not fail fatally, although this is
not a real problem.

Chain 15-18: We should succeed, the reason we don't is that we use
memcmp for DN comparisons.

Chain 19: I don't understand why this test should fail?  The chain
seems fine to me.

Chain 28-29: We fail to check keyCertSign (non-)critical key usage in
intermediate certificates.  XXX

Chain 31-32: The CRL is issued by a issuer without CRLSign
(non-)critical keyCertSign.  We don't check the CRL, so this is not a
real problem.

Chain 54-63: We don't check path length constraints properly. XXX
